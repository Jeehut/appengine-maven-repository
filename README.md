# Installation

### Create a new Project
First of all, you'll need to go to your [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/appengine/create?lang=java&st=true) to create a new App Engine application: 
Make sure the project Id is something meaningful. It should be the company name for example. This will be the maven URL used to download the dependencies.

As soon as your project is created, a default [Google Cloud storage bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) has been automatically created for you which provides the first 5GB of storage for free.

### Setup the Google Cloud SDK

Follow the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/) to install the latest Google Cloud SDK. As a shorthand, you'll find below the Ubuntu/Debian instructions:


```bash
$ export CLOUD_SDK_REPO="cloud-sdk-$(lsb_release -c -s)"
$ echo "deb http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $CLOUD_SDK_REPO main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
$ curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk
```

As a last step, configure the `gcloud` command line environment and select your newly created App Engine project when requested to do so:

```bash
$ gcloud init
```

## Configuration

Clone the project

Update [`WEB-INF/users.txt`](src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/users.txt) to declare users, passwords and permissions:

```ini
# That file declares your users - using basic authentication.
# Minimalistic access control is provided through the following permissions: write, read, or list.
# Syntax is:
# <username>:<password>:<permission>
# (use '*' as username and password to declare anonymous users)
*:*:read
admin:l33t:write
john:j123:read
donald:coolpw:read
guest:guest:list
```
> The `list` permission allows users to list the content of the repository but prohibits downloads. The `read` permission allows downloads (and implies `list`). The `write` permission allows uploads (and implies `read`).

> Anonymous users are supported by using "*" for both username and password. For example, `*:*:read` will allow anonymous read access. 

We can keep `*:*:read` to allow all the developers to download the dependencies Or maybe specify one account for reading.

## Deployment

Replace `GCLOUD_CONFIG` in the `build.gradle` file to the project Id created before.
```
appengine {
    deploy {
        projectId = 'GCLOUD_CONFIG'
        version = 'v1'
    }
}
```
Once you're ready to go live, just push the application to Google App-Engine:

```bash
$ cd appengine-maven-repository
$ ./gradlew appengineDeploy
```
Or you can run the gradle task `appengineDeploy` from Android Studio. 

And voil√†! Your private Maven repository is hosted and running at the following address:

`https://company-android-libraries.appspot.com`

# Publish a library

Make sure to build the project with the release build type before publishing.
An example publishing artifacts using the maven plugin for Gradle:

```gradle
apply plugin: 'maven-publish'

...

publishing {
    publications {
        maven(MavenPublication) {
            groupId 'com.company-android-libraries'
            artifactId 'utility-android'
            version '1.0.0'
            artifact("$buildDir/outputs/aar/utility-debug.aar") // here the file that will be uploaded.
        }
    }
    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://company-android-libraries.appspot.com"
            credentials {
                username 'username' // here add the user that has the write permission.
                password 'password'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Using the above plugin, publishing artifacts to your repository is as simple as:

```bash
$ ./gradlew publish
```
Or you can run the gradle task `publish` from the Android Studio after syncing the project.

In the other way, accessing password protected Maven repositories using Gradle only requires you to specify the `credentials` closure:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        credentials {
            username 'user' // user that has a read access or maybe you can remove the credentials block if you allow the artifact to be accessible without authentication.
            password 'password'
        }
        url "https://company-android-libraries.appspot.com"
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.company-android-libraries:utility-android:1.0.0"
}
```


# Limitations

Google App-Engine HTTP requests are limited to 32MB - and thus, any artifacts above that limit can't be hosted.
